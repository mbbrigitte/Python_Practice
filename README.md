# Python Practice

In [Hackerrank_challenges.ipynb](https://github.com/mbbrigitte/Python_Practice/blob/master/Hackerrank_challenges.ipynb)  I work through some concepts in python such as loops, recursion, working with strings and error exceptions. These practices are from  [hackerrank.com] (https://www.hackerrank.com/) which I highly recommend to practice python.
