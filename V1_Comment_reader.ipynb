It has now a category that includes everyone doing great, like all students.\n",
        "I'm glad that I found this series of articles.  Very interesting!\n",
        "Good stuff Frank, as always. Footnote number 3 had me a bit agitated, because I have always thought it was \"to a buxom girl in Luxembourg\", but I just re-listened to \"Ask\" and yes, you are right, she had big teeth, not big breasts. However to save face I must disagree with you about the set-up: I don't think the penpal thing with big-tooth girl ever happened, it was just Morrissey portraying a typical experience of a lonely, sensitive bedsit boy, whose only emotional outlet, pre-Internet, was to write frightening verse etc etc to extroverted girls in obscure countries. Not that I would know, ahem. But I digress.\n",
        "Excellent brief article but, in relation to note 6, no mention of the great photographer Edward (\u00c9duard) Steichen?\n",
        "Another delightful lesson in geography and history.  Thanks so much!\n",
        "I had the pleasure of being in Luxembourg around May, 1974. It is filled with history of French and German hypocrisy. Maybe that's the way it should be. \n",
        "A friend of mine who worked at the English Service of Radio Luxembourg in the 1970s and 1980s used to refer to Luxembourg as \"the center of Europe and the middle of nowhere.\" I enjoyed all of my many trips to Luxy, but I get his point.\n",
        "A newspaper article with footnotes!  What a lovely and learned pause from the crises and frictions of the day.  In spite of the quaint controversies that Frank Jacobs stirred up with his theory for understanding Pashtun pugnacity, called Zomia, his series on geographical history is what makes the NYT a great read.<br/>\n",
        "Keep 'em comin'!<br/>\n",
        "D.J.\n",
        "For 1000 years, Luxembourg was  part of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nationality.  Pundits say that it was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire and not even all that German.  Still, Luxembourg was part of that structure and even provided several emperors.   After Napoleon did away with the empire, the last one became Emperor of Austria in 1806.<br/>\n",
        "After 1806, the many principalities that formerly owed allegiance to the Emperor became independent  and some like the Grand Duke of Wuerttemberg and the one in Hanover made themselves King.  Within 50 years, and with the onset of industrialization, most recognized that they could no longer function completely on their own and formed the North German Customs Union.  For reasons of their own, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, of the House of Nassau, refused to join the customs union.  When the North German states fought Austria in 1866 and won, Luxembourg remained neutral as they did when all German states fought the French in 1870.  The Second German Reich was declared in Paris in 1871, again without Luxembourg.  That's when Luxembourg definitely left Germany of which it had been an integral part for a thousand years.  Of the countless German principalities only Luxembourg and Liechtenstein remained independent after 1870.  And both can afford to do so only because their banking laws allow citizens of other countries to deposit their money there without fear of taxation.  That's what allows them to remain independent and prosperous.\n",
        "Luxembourg's existence is symbiotic with the larger border nations.  Their low \"vat tax' structure has \"foreigners\" driving cross border to purchase gas, liquor, etc. at a substantial savings (US-ers, think of a vat tax as 30% sales tax, built into the retail price of everything)<br/><br/>Should Luxembourg grow too much, they will lose their ability to leverage this \"subsidy\" from Germany, France and Belgium.  And then how would they support the rumored 2 billion euro annual budget of the royal family. <br/><br/>If Europe ever achieves common tax rates across borders Luxembourg will be in big trouble.\n",
        "The map does not make clear what the white portion (within the red dotted lines) denotes.  Anyone know?  Am I missing something obvious?\n",
        "An interesting article! However, I find the sentence \"of its last four prime ministers, one went on to become president of the United Nations General Assembly, another of the European Commission, and a third of the Eurogroup\" somewhat misleading, since not one but two Luxembourgers have held the office of President of the European Commission: Gaston Thorn and Jacques Santer (cfr. e.g. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission#List_of_presidents)\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission#List_of_presidents)\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission#List_o...</a>\n",
        "My only regret on Mr. Jacobs' delightful article is that he omits the reason Luxembourg almost alone (Liechtenstein too) survives of the member-states of the German Confederation of 1815-1866. <br/><br/>The town was the mightiest fortress in Central Europe, considered impregnable. The conferees at Vienna in 1815 were determined that it be in the hands of a strong state in case Napoleonic ambitions ever returned to France. Therefore the duchy and the rest of the old Austrian Netherlands were united with the northern Netherlands, whose Protestant king was found dictatorial and unsympathetic in the south. The army's garrison, however, were Prussians, and when the southern Netherlands revolted (becoming Belgium), the Prussians refused to go and Luxembourg remained part of the Confederation. Luxembourg therefore had to be partitioned, Belgium only getting the (larger) half. <br/><br/>The rest remained under Prussian control until 1871, when as part of the deal for recognizing Prussia as the German Empire (the Second Reich), Britain and Russia insisted that Prussia evacuate the fortress. Bismarck (who had earlier, in 1866, pretended to offer the grand duchy to Napoleon III in order to secure his neutrality during the war with Austria -- a trick Napoleon never forgave), agreed to give the place up, but only on condition that the fortress was destroyed. The fortifications were, accordingly, blown sky high. \n",
        "Very enjoyable and fun series! As for recreating Middle Francia in the Plan B scenario, stranger things have happened, but imagining it extending from \"Amsterdam to Athens\" would appear to based more on alliteration (and perhaps one too many Weissbiers) than the former borders of Middle Francia--modern day Rijeka in Croatia would roughly mark its southeastern-most advance.     \n",
        "What an odd and irrelevant article.<br/><br/>The whole narrative is based on the machinations of the feudal lords of the past. These idiocies resulted in the borders we have today in Europe, and these borders are vehemently defended by petty national politicians (who have nothing else to show for) and a population that cannot look beyond its own garden fence.<br/><br/>Europe is a huge patchwork of regions with particular languages, customs and cultural identities. Almost all of these regions extend across the artificial political borders. There are numerous examples where the local people feel much closer to their neighbours across the border than to their compatriots in the capital.<br/><br/>Obviously, the people of Luxembourg have their own particular language, and it is nothing else than a German dialect. Any German west of the Rhine could understand it, but no French-speaker would. If Luxembourg would be part of Germany, it would not be any odder than Bavaria.<br/><br/>The future of Europe has to lie in strong regions, not in nation states that are almost entirely based on some horse trading by the feudal lords centuries ago.\n",
        "Let\u2019s not forget all those late nights when John Lennon listened to Radio Luxembourg and gained his introduction to American R&amp;B.  Rock and Roll as we know it today was formed in no small part because of it.<br/><br/>The BBC had a monopoly on radio in the UK up until 1973 and played a pretty restricted range of popular music.  Since the BBC banned advertising, Radio Luxembourg found it profitable to create an English language service and play genres like R&amp;B interspersed with commercials aimed at listeners in the UK and Ireland.   <br/><br/>In many interviews, John Lennon credited those hours of listening to Radio Luxembourg as one of his earliest inspirations as a singer and song writer.  \n",
        "There still is a serious argument between The Netherlands (\"Big Bully\") and Luxembourg (\"Small Dwarf\") which is the color of their flags (both Red-White-Blue).  The Dutch claim that they got it first and that Luxembourg, way back, was part of them.  The Luxembourgers say that is not true at all, etc.  Still they love each other thanks to fairly recent and frequent Royal Inbreeding until Emperor Bonapart around 1800 took control there and told everybody to either behave or be beheaded.      \n",
        "There't nothing about demographics in this article. A huge proportion of the population is non native. Both Portuguese and Italians are common there. Portuguese alone make up about 20% of the population of Luxembourg.\n",
        "Frank Jacobs totally gets it! - I could not have said it better myself....  Wait, I did! - Conclusion of my e-book: Storms Over Luxembourg (2009):<br/><br/>\"The European Union (EU), of currently 27 member states, is essentially an economic union. Though it is supposed to be also a political union, time and time again, a common position on important world affairs has eluded her leaders. In all camps there are still some deeply entrenched gut feelings of wariness, difficult to overcome. Europeans have their history in common, though their elders were not always on the same side of conflicts.<br/>\n",
        "The basic political tenet of nineteenth century\u2019s emperors and kings was that a nation had to be large in territory, the larger, the better. Size mattered. Post World War II European history has seemingly cracked that belief. The smaller, the better. The small European nations, many of them constitutional monarchies, have thrived. Maybe because their problems are proportionate to the size of the country or maybe because they are just a large family; eventually everybody within the country becomes related to everybody else. Whatever the reasons, the small Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is prosperous, a firm supporter of a unified Europe for which her politicians from Joseph Bech, to Pierre Werner, Gaston Thorn, Jacques Santer and Jean-Claude Juncker, have often played the role of mediator between neighbors at odds. After all, they are the progeny of Lotharingia, the lands in the middle.\"\n",
        "Keep these background pieces coming: they provide great perspective!  Unfortunately, there was no mention of the plebecite in 1955, in which the population of Saarland had the chance to enter into a union with Luxembourg and Lorraine, from which the EU would have been administered.  recently, my Saarland relatives again regretted that the Germans voted to return to Germany.<br/><br/>Another interesting development was the suggestion from a politician in Baden-Wuerttemberg that the German state withdraw from the GDR and join the Swiss Confederation.  In BW, there is a lot of popular support for this idea on a theoretical level. If  the idea grew legs, though, it would make a lot of sense to join up with a Saar-Lo-Lux union because this is a homogeneous cultural area, based on the ancient Allemanian tribes, and the original empire of Charlemagne.  Of course, it would be the richest and by far the most economically vital region in Europe, thus a nightmare for those areas accustomed to hanging in the teats of others.\n",
        "I seriously think this column is the result of a dare: \"Use irredentism in a sentence.\"  Game win for the phrase: \"*sublimated* irredentism.\"\n",
        "As a Luxembourger I have enjoyed reading this because of its style and the many true facts.<br/>\n",
        "May I nevertheless point out that during the past 20 years, the cultural and social development of the City of Luxembourg  has been outstanding and if you went any evening to the Philharmony, the Grund or the Atelier area you would probably disagree as much as me with any reference to boredom.<br/>\n",
        "There is not a more international city in the world with a combination of quiet, woods, landscapes, culture,  fun. gastronomy of high quality, local pubs<br/>\n",
        "and so much more!<br/>\n",
        "As a recruiter during 30 years in Luxembourg  I have met so many executives coming from all over the globe \"for 3-4 years\", who were still in Luxembourg 20 years later and raised their children in this safe beautifull place. And the children become Luxembourgers - and spend their life here !<br/>\n",
        "In Luxembourg we may be missing the sun, but within a one hour flight (and for most of Luxembourg  30 minutes to the airport :-) )we reach the nicest beaches and sky resorts and virtually all of Europe.<br/><br/>Again: Thank you very much Frank Jacobs !

It has rather low rates of corporate and personal income tax generally (by Western European standards, at least) and less red tape than many of its neighbours (notably Belgium). Until quite recently Luxembourg had a special form of holding company, the '1929 company', which, provided it didn't do any business directly in Luxembourg, was exempt from Luxembourg tax entirely. VAT is also the lowest in the EU, at 15%, which is particularly important for e-commerce since VAT on intra-EU transactions is charged at the rate of the seller's country. Plus, of course, the natural advantages of geographic centrality, stability, and a populace fluently trilingual in English, French, and German.\n",

The District of Columbia was originally a square 10 miles on a side or 100 square miles, that was reduced to its present size of about 68 square miles when Virginia took back its chunk.
